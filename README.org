*Disclaimer:* Learning NixOS one configuration at a time. Take this with a grain of salt, but it works for me!

* Introduction
This is my personal NixOS configuration, split into a modular structure for maintainability. What started as a single massive org-mode file has evolved into a well-organized repository that declares my entire computing landscape.

This represents the *One REPO to Rule Them All*: My complete system configuration is declared right here. This is the power of Nix - declarative, reproducible, and rollback-capable systems management.

[[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] provides the perfect balance between bleeding-edge software and stable system management. Unlike traditional distributions where configurations get lost over time or drift between machines, NixOS ensures consistency and allows easy rollbacks when things go wrong.

** Quick Setup Guide
*** For Existing NixOS Systems:
1. Clone this repository
2. Backup your current configuration
3. Copy relevant parts to match this structure
4. Run: ~sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hostname~

*** Maintenance Commands:
- ~sudo nixos-rebuild switch~ - Apply changes
- ~sudo nixos-rebuild build~ - Build without applying
- ~nix-collect-garbage -d~ - Clean old generations
- ~home-manager switch --flake .#hostname~ - Update user config

* Dotfiles
This directory contains all dotfiles for the programs and tooling I use. I use home-manager's ~mkOutOfStoreSymlink~ to symlink and keep these files organized within this one config - simplification is beautiful. See the section on the home-manager module below.
